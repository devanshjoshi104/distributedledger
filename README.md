# Decentralized Book Exchange (DBE) Using Ethereum Blockchain
Students can browse and borrow books directly from other students through a Decentralized Book Exchange or (DeBex). It is a Web3 application that is P2P based. Let's look at some of the main points in order to comprehend the issue thoroughly.
What are the major flaws in the current system? 
P1-> Non-digital - Using a non-digital system to store such vital information renders the entire system inefficient and unmanageable. 
P2-> Centralized - Even creating a database for the system with a query interface will not solve our problem because any lab operator can manipulate it. For instance, if we want to know who currently owns pc-1, we must examine its borrowing trail, which the operators can manipulate.
Possible solutions
To solve this problem, we can envision an application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database. However, this only translates to P1. For P2, we must employ the most recent computer science concept, Blockchain. We must explicitly design a distributed ledger system for our campus labs in order to store the necessary equipment tracking information.


Create a web application to interact with the smart contract. 
The client web app includes a home page that displays all of the books along with the current owner's information. 
Users can request to borrow the book. 
By approving the request, users can give the new borrower ownership of the book. 







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
